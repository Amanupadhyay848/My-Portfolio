# Portfolio Web Page with GSAP Animations & ScrollTrigger

This project is a personal portfolio webpage that showcases my skills, experience, and projects, enhanced with smooth animations using **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) and **ScrollTrigger**. The webpage features custom animations triggered by mouse movements and scrolling, providing an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Custom Cursor Animation**: The cursor smoothly follows the mouse and dynamically changes its size and appearance.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Navigation links grow and change opacity when hovered, creating an interactive experience.
- **Page Load Animations**: Headings, buttons, and other elements appear with smooth animations as the page loads.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Elements animate in based on the userâ€™s scroll position, adding interactivity to sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to work on a variety of screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including responsive design for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: To implement interactive animations using GSAP and ScrollTrigger.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust animation library for creating high-performance animations.
- **ScrollTrigger**: A GSAP plugin that enables scroll-based animations.


## Usage

- **Custom Cursor**: As you move your mouse, the cursor dynamically follows the movement, scaling up with an easing effect.
- **Page Animations**: Various elements such as headers, buttons, and sections animate into view on page load and while scrolling.
- **ScrollTrigger Animations**: Animations for sections (e.g., About, Skills, Projects, and Contact) trigger based on your scroll position, creating an immersive experience.

## Code Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file where the structure of the webpage is defined.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that includes layout styles, animations, and responsiveness.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles GSAP and ScrollTrigger animations.
